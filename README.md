# Arduino UNO based projectile launcher

## Description

This project contains code wich enables full controll over movements of tiny 3D printed projectile launcher. This toy-sized bad boy was designed to perform fun tasks for the public at Silesian Univeristy "Night of Scientists" event. It's main and only purpose is to provide fun for audience visiting our science club throughout this particular evening. Our war machine contains of two **M1173030 stepper motors**, two **stepper motor drivers** (various kinds, working the same way). 

### Electrical design

The electrical circuit of this deadly cannon is powered by **two racks of four 1.5V AA batteries each**, connected in series.

1. Clone the repository
2. Send the code to the Arduino UNO board.

## Usage

- ***Button 1** allows for switching the controlled stepper motor,
- ***Button 2** rotates current stepper motor one way,
- ***Button 3** rotates current stepper motor the other way.

That's pretty much it ðŸ˜…
